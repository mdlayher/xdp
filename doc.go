// Package xdp provides access to Linux userspace XDP sockets (AF_XDP).
//
// Help wanted!
//
// I'm very interested in trying out `AF_XDP` with Go programs, but I lack the
// C background to effectively port the example code to Go. Contributions are
// very welcome, and once we get a working example, I'm happy to participate in
// discussions about what the package's API should look like.
//
// If this interests you, please reach out via an issue!
