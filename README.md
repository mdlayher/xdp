Package `xdp` provides access to Linux userspace XDP sockets (`AF_XDP`).

MIT Licensed.

## Help wanted!

I'm very interested in trying out `AF_XDP` with Go programs, but I lack the
C background to effectively port the example code to Go. Contributions are very
welcome, and once we get a working example, I'm happy to participate in
discussions about what the package's API should look like.

If this interests you, please reach out via an issue!
